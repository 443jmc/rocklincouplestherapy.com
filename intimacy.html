      <h1>Intimacy</h1>
      <p>True intimacy requires courage -- the willingness to be fully known by another person, including the parts of yourself you'd rather hide.</p>

          <h2>Intimacy Is More Than Closeness</h2>
          <p>Most people think of intimacy as feeling close, connected, and warm. But genuine intimacy goes deeper than comfort. It means being willing to be seen as you truly are -- not the version of yourself you think your partner wants.</p>
          <p>This kind of intimacy requires what David Schnarch called self-validated intimacy: the ability to share yourself openly without needing your partner's approval or reassurance to feel okay about what you've shared.</p>
          <p>It's the difference between saying "I love you" to hear it back, and saying "I love you" because it's true -- regardless of the response.</p>

  <!-- Sexual Desire -->
  <section class="section section--alt">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Understanding Sexual Desire</h2>
        <p>Differences in sexual desire are one of the most common reasons couples seek therapy. They're also one of the greatest opportunities for growth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="principles">
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Differences in Desire Are Normal</h4>
          <p>In every committed relationship, one partner will have higher desire than the other. This isn't a flaw in the relationship -- it's a natural dynamic that creates an opportunity for both partners to grow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Desire and Self-Worth</h4>
          <p>Many people use sex to extract validation from their partner. When desire is driven by the need to feel wanted rather than genuine connection, both partners feel it -- and it erodes intimacy over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>The Lower-Desire Partner's Experience</h4>
          <p>The lower-desire partner often carries the weight of feeling pressured, guilty, or inadequate. Understanding their experience -- without blaming them -- is essential for change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Growth Through Monogamy</h4>
          <p>Monogamy isn't a limitation. It's a container for growth. When you can't run to someone new, you're forced to grow within the relationship you have. That growth deepens desire.</p>

  <!-- Emotional Intimacy -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content-block content-block--reverse">
        <div class="content-block__text">
          <h2>Emotional Intimacy Takes Courage</h2>
          <p>Emotional intimacy means letting your partner see the parts of you that you normally protect -- your fears, your insecurities, the things you're ashamed of. It takes courage because there's no guarantee your partner will respond the way you hope.</p>
          <p>Many couples confuse emotional fusion with emotional intimacy. Fusion means losing yourself in the relationship -- needing your partner to feel the same way you do, needing constant reassurance, being unable to tolerate disagreement.</p>
          <p>Genuine intimacy requires differentiation: holding onto yourself while staying connected to your partner. It means being close without losing who you are.</p>

        <h2>Four Points of Balance</h2>
        <p>David Schnarch's four points of balance provide the foundation for deeper intimacy in your relationship.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-grid" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">
        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Solid Flexible Self</h4>
          <p>A strong core identity that bends without breaking. Like a tree trunk -- rooted and steady, but able to move with the wind. You know who you are, even under pressure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Quiet Mind, Calm Heart</h4>
          <p>The ability to soothe yourself when anxiety rises. Like a calm pond -- still and clear enough to reflect accurately. You can think clearly even when emotions are strong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Grounded Responding</h4>
          <p>Pausing before you react. Rather than responding from impulse, you take a breath and respond from wisdom. You choose your response instead of being driven by it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Meaningful Endurance</h4>
          <p>The capacity to tolerate discomfort for the sake of growth. Staying in the difficult conversation. Sitting with the anxiety. Not running from the hard parts of love.</p>
